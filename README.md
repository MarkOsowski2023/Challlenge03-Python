# PyBank
Looping through csv file of budget data, I set variables for date and profit/loss as open lists.
I set variables for total months, total profits/loss, current month's proftit/loss, last months profit/loss, and change(in profit/loss) and set them to 0.
Read the csv file and set up loop

used print staements and f strings to print results
